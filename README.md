# World_layoffs-Data-Cleaning
I transformed a raw global layoffs dataset into a structured, reliable format by handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and validating the data. The result is an accurate, comprehensive dataset ready for analysis to identify layoff trends worldwide.

In this project, I tackled the intricate task of cleaning and organizing a comprehensive dataset on global layoffs. The objective was to transform raw, messy data into a structured, reliable format that can be easily analyzed and interpreted. Key steps included:
Data Collection: We aggregated data from various sources, including news articles, company reports, and industry publications. This ensured a wide-ranging dataset encompassing layoffs across different sectors and regions.
Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values: We identified and addressed missing values using appropriate imputation techniques or by removing incomplete records where necessary.
Standardizing Formats: Data entries were standardized to ensure consistency in dates, numerical values, and categorical variables.
Removing Duplicates: We carefully scanned for and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Correcting Errors: Any inaccuracies or anomalies in the data were identified and corrected based on cross-referencing with trusted sources.
The result is a meticulously cleaned dataset that provides a robust foundation for analyzing global layoff trends, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions. This project not only enhances the quality of the data but also contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of workforce changes on a global scale.
