I transformed a raw global layoffs dataset into a structured, reliable format by handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and validating the data. The result is an accurate, comprehensive dataset ready for analysis to identify layoff trends worldwide.

In this project, I tackled the intricate task of cleaning and organizing a comprehensive dataset on global layoffs. The objective was to transform raw, messy data into a structured, reliable format that can be easily analyzed and interpreted. Key steps included:
Data Collection: We aggregated data from various sources, including news articles, company reports, and industry publications. This ensured a wide-ranging dataset encompassing layoffs across different sectors and regions.
Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values: We identified and addressed missing values using appropriate imputation techniques or by removing incomplete records where necessary.
Standardizing Formats: Data entries were standardized to ensure consistency in dates, numerical values, and categorical variables.
Removing Duplicates: We carefully scanned for and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Correcting Errors: Any inaccuracies or anomalies in the data were identified and corrected based on cross-referencing with trusted sources.
The result is a meticulously cleaned dataset that provides a robust foundation for analyzing global layoff trends, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions. This project not only enhances the quality of the data but also contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of workforce changes on a global scale.

Data Exploriation:
In the World Layoffs Data Exploration and Analysis Project, I conducted an in-depth examination of the cleaned global layoffs dataset to uncover significant trends and patterns. in my exploration began with data retrieval, extracting all records from the layoffs_staging2 dataset. I identified the maximum values for total layoffs and percentage of layoffs to understand the most significant events in the dataset. We focused on cases where 100% of the workforce was laid off, ordering the results by total layoffs and funds raised to highlight extreme instances. Aggregating total layoffs by company provided a clear picture of which companies experienced the most layoffs. We analyzed the data over time, grouping layoffs by date, month, and year to identify trends. Additionally, we examined layoffs by industry and country to see which sectors and regions were most affected. We also summarized layoffs by company stage to understand whether startups or more established companies were more likely to lay off employees. By calculating the rolling total of layoffs by month, we observed cumulative trends over time. We further explored layoffs by company and year, identifying companies with the highest layoffs in a given year and ranking them using dense ranking within each year to focus on the top five companies annually. This comprehensive exploration and analysis provided valuable insights into the dynamics of global layoffs, highlighting key factors, trends, and patterns, and laying the groundwork for informed decision-making and further detailed analyses.
